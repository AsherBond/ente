 *   fetched from remote storage.
 *
 * - "file-status": Contains {@link FileStatus} objects, one for each
 *   {@link EnteFile} that the current client knows about.
 *
 * Both the stores are keyed by {@link fileID}, and are expected to contain the
 * exact same set of {@link fileID}s. The face-index can be thought of as the
 * "original" indexing result, whilst file-status bookkeeps information about
 * the indexing process (whether or not a file needs indexing, or if there were
 * errors doing so).

 * In tandem, these serve as the underlying storage for the functions exposed by
