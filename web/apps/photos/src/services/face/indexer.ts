/**
 * Face indexing orchestrator.

 * This module exposes a singleton instance of this class which drives the face
 * indexing process on the user's library.
 *
 * The indexer operates in two modes - live indexing and backfill.
 *
 * When live indexing, any files that are being uploaded from the current client
 * are provided to the indexer, which puts them in a queue and indexes them one
 * by one. This is more efficient since we already have the file's content at
 * hand and do not have to download and decrypt it.
 *
 * When backfilling, the indexer figures out if any of the user's files
 * (irrespective of where they were uploaded from) still need to be indexed, and
 * if so, downloads, decrypts and indexes them.
 *
 * Live indexing has higher priority, backfilling runs otherwise. If nothing
 * remains to be indexed, the indexer goes to sleep for a while.
